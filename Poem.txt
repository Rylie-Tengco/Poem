A Happy Life

A life that's bright with skies of blue,
Where laughter flows, and dreams come true.
Each simple joy, a treasure found,
In every heart, a peaceful sound.

The sun may set, the stars may climb,
But happiness feels like endless time.
With love and light, the world is right,
A happy life, a pure delight.
